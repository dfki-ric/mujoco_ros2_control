 * @brief Mujoco System Interface
 *
 * This file contains the declaration of the MujocoSystemInterface class, which provides API-level access to read and
 * command joint properties in a Mujoco simulation. It extends the hardware_interface::SystemInterface and is designed
 * to be implemented by classes that interact with the Mujoco simulation and integrate it with the ROS 2 control
 * framework.

 * The `mujoco_ros2_control` namespace provides the necessary classes and interfaces for integrating Mujoco simulations
 * with the ROS 2 control framework. It includes the `MujocoSystemInterface` class, which serves as the API-level access
 * point for reading and commanding joint properties in the Mujoco simulation.
 *
 * This namespace is designed to be used alongside the ROS 2 control system to enable control of Mujoco-based robot
 * models. It provides the necessary abstractions and interfaces to bridge the gap between the Mujoco simulation and
 * the control framework, allowing for seamless integration and control of robot models in Mujoco.
